Clears the repository to a state that it looks as if it was freshly cloned
with the current HEAD, however, preserving all changes that are located in files and directories listed in .gitignore. It is a git-reset --hard together with
deletion of all untracked files that reside inside the working directory, excluding those in .gitignore.

OPTIONS:
    -f, --force               Don't prompt for confirmation to clear
    -h, --help                Show this message
